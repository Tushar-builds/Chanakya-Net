 Chanakya-Net

AI-Powered Public Audit & Fraud Detection System

Chanakya-Net is a prototype AI-driven audit engine designed to detect collusion, financial anomalies, and ghost projects in public infrastructure spending.
It combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), anomaly detection, and cyber-physical verification concepts into a single explainable framework.
 Problem Statement

Traditional public audits are:

Reactive (fraud detected after money is spent)

Manual and slow

Limited to rule-based checks

Unable to detect network-level collusion

As a result, coordinated fraud (shell companies, shared directors, shared bank accounts) often goes undetected.
 Our Solution

Chanakya-Net transforms auditing into a proactive, data-driven process by:

Modeling entities (companies, people, accounts) as a graph

Learning hidden relationships using Graph Neural Networks

Detecting abnormal financial behavior using unsupervised anomaly detection

Producing risk scores instead of binary rules

Remaining explainable and scalable
 Core Technologies
